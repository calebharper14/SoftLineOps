# SoftLineOps Project TODO

## 1. Project Structure & Setup
- [x] Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite
- [x] Backend: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL
- [x] Monorepo with clear directory structure
- [x] Environment config (.env for secrets/URLs)
- [x] Git workflow: feature branches, develop/integration branch

---

## 2. Frontend Tasks
- [x] Modern UI/UX: Neumorphism, gradients, responsive design
- [x] Animated backgrounds, transitions, and micro-interactions
- [x] Login page: authentication flow, error handling
- [x] Dashboard: stats, recent issues, device health, notifications
- [x] Navbar: dropdown menu, section navigation, logout
- [x] Card layouts: table-like formatting, consistent sizing
- [ ] API integration: replace mock data with backend calls
- [ ] State management: loading, error, and auth states
- [ ] Role-based views: End-user vs Admin dashboard features
- [ ] Accessibility: keyboard navigation, ARIA labels
- [ ] Unit and integration tests (Jest/React Testing Library)

---

## 3. Backend Tasks
- [x] Express server setup
- [x] PostgreSQL schema: users, devices, issues, device_health
- [x] RESTful API endpoints: auth, users, devices, issues, health
- [x] JWT authentication & role-based access control
- [x] Security: helmet, CORS, rate limiting, input validation
- [x] Error handling: consistent JSON responses
- [x] API documentation (README or Swagger)
- [ ] Integration tests (Jest/Supertest)
- [ ] Performance tuning: indexes, query optimization

---

## 4. Integration Tasks
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend API (login, dashboard, issue reporting, device health)
- [ ] Store JWT token securely (localStorage or httpOnly cookie)
- [ ] Handle protected routes and redirects
- [ ] Replace all mock data with live API data
- [ ] Test full stack flows: login, issue creation, device health updates

---

## 5. Database Tasks
- [x] Install and configure PostgreSQL
- [x] Create and migrate schema
- [x] Seed initial data (optional)
- [ ] Backup and restore scripts
- [ ] Automated migrations for future updates

---

## 6. Deployment & DevOps

- [ ] Environment variables for production
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions or similar)
- [ ] Production database setup
- [ ] Monitoring and logging (health checks, error logs)
- [ ] Secure deployment (HTTPS, secrets management)

---

## 7. Documentation
- [ ] Update README with setup, usage, and API docs
- [ ] Add frontend usage guide (role-based features, navigation)
- [ ] Add backend API reference (endpoints, request/response samples)
- [ ] Add troubleshooting and FAQ section

---

## 8. Future Enhancements
- [ ] Real-time updates (WebSocket for notifications/device health)
- [ ] Advanced analytics and reporting (charts, exports)
- [ ] User profile management
- [ ] Device agent improvements (Python)
- [ ] Mobile-friendly enhancements

---

## Current Status
**Frontend and backend are running. Ready for full API integration and database setup.**
