## Next Phase: Integration & Testing ðŸŽ¯
**Priority: HIGH - Ready to start Phase 4**

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Backend Testing**
   - Test API endpoints with Postman/curl
   - Set up PostgreSQL database
   - Create .env file with database credentials
   - Test authentication flow

2. **Frontend-Backend Integration**
   - Connect React frontend to backend API
   - Implement real authentication in frontend
   - Replace mock data with API calls
   - Add error handling and loading states

3. **Database Setup**
   - Install PostgreSQL locally
   - Create softlineops database
   - Test database connection and table creation
   - Add sample data for testing
